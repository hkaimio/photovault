Photovault 0.2.alpha1
Release notes

!!!!NOTE!!!!! Read at least section about backwards compatibility before upgrading!

0.2.alpha1 is intended for getting feedback on new features in Photovault 0.2. 
It has not received full testing needed for production release and is not 
recommended for general use.

MAIN CHANGES IN PHOTOVAULT 0.2
The biggest change in Photovault 0.2 is support for external volumes: Previously
Photovault could only manage images stored in its own database. While this is OK
when importing new images it was not convenient way to work with large existing 
archives since Photovault created a new copy of each image file and thus doubled
disk usage.

In Photovault 0.2 this can be solved by defining the existing archive directory as
an external volume. THen Photovault stores only metadata and a thumbnail of the 
photos in its database. The actual image files are accessed from original directory.
Photovault will also track any changes or additions made to the external volume 
directory.

Other changes:
- Shortcut keys for moving between images in the same folder
- Use launch4j for starting Photovault (instead if NSIS)

BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY
Due to external olume support the database schema used by Photovault has changed. 
If you open a database created with earlied version Photovault will automatically
convert the database schema. This can take significant amount of time if there are
lots of existing images in the database.

Using old 0.1 version after upgrading is not recommended since making changes with it
may leave database into inconsistent state.

REQUIRED SOFTWARE
Photovault needs Sub Java JRE 1.5 and Java Advanced Imaging libraries
to work. You can download both from Sun web site.

Photovault can use either Apache Derby or MySQL as metadata
store. Derby is included in this release; if you want to use MySQL
instead you need to download it from www.mysql.com.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
Briefly:
- Install Java 1.5

KNOWN ISSUES
- Tracking updates to external volume is disabled in 0.2.alpha1
