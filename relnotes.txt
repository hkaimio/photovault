BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY
Photovault 0.3.0 database format is compatible with 0.2.0. However,
Photovault 0.2 cannot correctly display cropped or rotated images.

Photovault converts automatically databases created with versions prior to
0.2.0 to the new format. Using Photovault 0.1.x after the conversion is
not recommended.

SUPPORTED OPERATING SYSTEMS
Photovault has been tested in Linux and Windows XP and it should work
in all environments supported by Java SE.Specifically, there are some 
compatibility problems in MacOS X (e.g. importing images form network
drive does not work) - these will be addressed in future release.

REQUIRED SOFTWARE
Photovault needs Sun Java JRE 1.4.2 or newer and Java Advanced Imaging 
libraries to work. You can download both from Sun web site.

Photovault can use either Apache Derby or MySQL as metadata
store. Derby is included in this release; if you want to use MySQL
instead you need to download it from www.mysql.com.
