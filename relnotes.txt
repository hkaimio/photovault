BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY

In 0.4.0, Photovault configuration file format has changed. The new configuration 
file is saved in <HOME_DIRECTORY>/.photovault/photovault_config.xml by default. 
If this file is not found Photovault will search for the old configuration file 
named photovault.xml in the same directory and if it exists it will use information
in it to create the new configuration file. The old confugration file is preserved
to allow usage of older versions, however, the old file is not updated with changes 
in configuration.

Photovault 0.4.0 adds new data structures to the database. If you open a database
created with earlier version of Photovault, the program converts the database
automatically to new format. The new database structure is backwards compatible 
with 0.2.0 and 0.3.0. However,  the earlier versions cannot display raw images, 
but it is possible to edit meta data and see icons of these photos.

SUPPORTED OPERATING SYSTEMS
Photovault has been tested in Linux and Windows XP and it should work
in all environments supported by Java SE. Specifically, there are some 
compatibility problems in MacOS X (e.g. importing images form network
drive does not work) - these will be addressed in future release.

Also, raw conversion support works out-of-the-box only in Winodws and x86 based
Linux machines. It is possible to use raw conversion in other architectures by 
supplying your own dcraw executable.

REQUIRED SOFTWARE
Photovault needs Sun Java JRE 1.4.2 or newer and Java Advanced Imaging 
libraries to work. You can download both from Sun web site.

Photovault can use either Apache Derby or MySQL as metadata
store. Derby is included in this release; if you want to use MySQL
instead you need to download it from www.mysql.com.
